        "description": "<p>Yes—they REALLY are that good! Our goal is to provide the highest quality skin care for men on the market. Your skin is inundated daily by unseen airborne chemicals, particles and light—which all increase the aging process and clog pores. As a guy trying to look your best in this competitive world, you want skin care products that can make a significant difference to your skin’s health.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>To have and maintain healthy skin, diet and exercise helps but it is essential to feed and exercise the skin from the outside in by unclogging pores, nourishing, tightening, brightening, firming and creating a soft, flexible protective barrier.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Tiege Hanley skin care systems used daily solve today’s problems and work to minimize tomorrow’s signs of aging.<\/p>"

We also don't have super high paid executives, expensive real-estate or stockholders. All this results in us being able to eliminate the CRAZY markups and margins that the other guys charge.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>We sent Aaron out on a mission to compare retail products to those found in the Tiege Hanley Systems. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nOjrW8jRB78\" title=\"Check out these videos\">CHECK OUT THESE VIDEOS to see the results!<\/a><\/p>"

        "description": "<p>Our WASH is designed to be gentle. Foaming in a cleanser only means there are lots of surfactants and does not equate to cleaning the skin. When cleansers have significant foaming, the chemicals that facilitate this action also deplete skin lipids that lead to dehydrating of the skin. \n\nOur WASH product contains very low concentrations of surfactants, so it cleans while helping to maintain your skin’s lipid balance. This makes it possible to moisturize while cleaning.<\/p>"
